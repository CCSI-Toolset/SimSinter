# SimSinter
**SimSinter for Aspen 7.3.2 or greater** Simulation interface for connecting Aspen Plus or ACM simulations to FOQUS and Turbine Gateway. Includes SinterConfigGUI.

## Development Practices

* Code development will be peformed in a forked copy of the repo. Commits will not be 
  made directly to the ngt-archive repo. Developers will submit a pull 
  request that is then merged by another team member, if another team member is available.
* Each pull request should contain only related modifications to a feature or bug fix.  
* Sensitive information (secret keys, usernames etc) and configuration data 
  (e.g database host port) should not be checked in to the repo.
* A practice of rebasing with the main repo should be used rather that merge commmits.

## Getting Started

TBD
