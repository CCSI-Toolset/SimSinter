UC2 is a Microsoft COM wrapper for UDUnits2 (which includes an XML
parser named expat). UDUnits2 is originally came from here:
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/

For CCSI purposes, we ported it to Windows and created a CMake
(http://cmake.org) build for it. Because it rarely changes since this
initial port, we haven't integrated its build into the normal CCSI
Jenkins process.  We checked in the binaries and XML files needed for
the COM wrapper.

The modified UDUnits2 code and CMake build files are in the udunits2
subdirectory here. Typically, one runs CMake on the CMakeLists.txt
file to produce a Microsoft Visual Studio file that is then used to
build the DLL and LIB files.
