FOQUS
=====

Overview
--------

The Framework for Optimization, Quantification of Uncertainty, and Surrogates (FOQUS) serves as the
primary computational platform enabling advanced Process Systems Engineering (PSE) capabilities to
be integrated with commercial process simulation software. It can be used to synthesize, design, and
optimize a complete carbon capture system while considering uncertainty. FOQUS enables users to
effectively screen potential capture concepts in the context of a complete industrial process so
that trade-offs can be appropriately evaluated. The technical and economic performance
characteristics of the capture process are highly dependent on employing an effective approach for
process synthesis. Since large-scale carbon capture processes are outside of current experience,
heuristic and evolutionary approaches are likely to be inadequate. Thus, a key aspect of FOQUS is
that it bridges this gap by supporting a superstructure-based approach to determine the optimal
process configuration and equipment interconnections.
